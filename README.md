# Who-am-i



My name is Tim. I am 17 years old and live i sweden, uppsala.

I have been writing code since i was around 15 years old in diffrent language.

My strongest language i Python. I also know syntaxs and the basics of JavaSript, HTML, CSS.

The projects on my github are just a fraction of the projects i have made. I only upload projects that reqiuer no special modules or other special content t.ex pictures. Also alot of my older projets (Chessengine, stockchart) have been outdated and dont run correctly whit new versions of the imported modules. I only upload projects that work correctly. Altough on demand i can upload the projects so you can see the code.


I have been runing my own electronic repair shop in my sparetime and thus i have experice with dealing with customers and real life work. I have also been working part time a at a buidling firm in uppsala where i have been working hourly helping to do demolition work and carry things around the build site. I have references if you request them.



I am looking forward to working with Python or any other programming language if the oppertunity presents itself!


I Have comepletede elemntry school with great grades and have completede 1.5 terms in highschool with a IT/Software program. I can send my grades on demand also.
